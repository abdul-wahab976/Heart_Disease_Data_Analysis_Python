# ❤️ Heart Disease Data Analysis 

This project is a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of heart disease patient data using Python. It highlights data-driven patterns that help uncover key health indicators linked to heart disease.

> A real-world healthcare analysis project focusing on visualization, feature exploration, and data cleaning using **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze a structured heart disease dataset and derive **meaningful insights** through:

- Cleaning missing or inconsistent values  
- Visualizing feature distributions and correlations  
- Identifying key patterns and predictors  
- Strengthening Python and data analysis skills

## 📊 Key Exploratory Steps

- Checked for nulls, duplicates, and data types  
- Converted categorical values to readable labels  
- Plotted distributions of age, cholesterol, blood pressure  
- Visualized correlation heatmaps and pairplots  
- Compared health metrics across `target` (presence of disease)

## 📈 Visual Insights

| Visualization             | Insight                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Age distribution          | Heart disease mostly affects patients over 50             |
| Chest pain vs Target      | Certain chest pain types have higher correlation          |
| Cholesterol trends        | High cholesterol is more frequent in affected patients    |
| Correlation Heatmap       | Identifies strong/weak relationships between features     |
| Target class balance      | Dataset is slightly imbalanced                            |
